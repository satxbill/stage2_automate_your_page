                <p>
                    HTML stands for <em>HyperText Markup Language</em>. HTML documents make up the 
                    majority of the content on the web. HTML documents contain <em>text content</em> 
                    which describes "what you see" and <em>markup</em> which describes "how it looks".

                <p>
                    HTML documents are comprised of <em>HTML Elements</em>. HTML Elements are defined using HTML Tags. Tags typically have begin and end components, with <em>void</em> type tags being an exception only having a single component. An example of a void tag is the "br" tag.
                </p>
                <p>
                    Some tags have content, some have content and attributes. Some tags are <em>inline</em>, menaing they work 'inline' with other HTML elements. Some tags are <em>block</em> - which for now means they create an invisible block in the HTML document that can have attributes which we'll learn about later.

                <p>CSS stands for "Cascading Style Sheet". Styles are inherited by elements with the style applied by the browser being the most specific style determined for a particular element</p>
                <p>This <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Cascading_Style_Sheets#Inheritance" target="_blank">link</a> references a great Wikipedia page on CSS Inheritance.</p>
                <p>This <a href="https://developer.mozilla.org/en-US/docs/Web/CSS/Reference" target="_blank">link</a> points to a great general CSS Reference page.</p>

            <div class="standard_content panel">
                <h2 class="standard_content_title">Divs, Spans, Classes &amp; Ids...</h2>
                <p><b>Divs</b> are mainly used to group items together to: 1) Logically organize our code, and 2) Group our items together so we can add styling to the whole block of code all at once. This avoids repetition because we don't have to single handedly assign the same styles to all of our elements inside our div block.
                </p>
                <p>Since <b>spans</b> are inline-level elements, they are usually not used to group items together and are used to style parts of text or a few elements together without affecting the layout of the page.
                </p>
                <p>
                    <b>Ids</b> are used to uniquely identify an element in the entire web page. That means div id="welcome" should be the only element with the unique identifier: "welcome". There should not be any other element with the name "welcome".
                </p>
                <p>
                    We should use id for special cases to give us the ability to uniquely identify elements and should be used sparingly because having a lot of id's in a website will slow our browser down.
                </p>
                <p>
                    Classes are used to style a group or groups of elements similarly.  Using classes enables the programmer to avoid repetition by grouping like elements and using a single CSS entry to define the style for those elements.

            <div class="standard_content panel">
                <h2 class="standard_content_title">A Note about Repetition</h2>
                <p>The previous paragraph mentioned the use of classes as a way to avoid repetition in code (and a way to help ensure consistency in how the web page will look). <b>Don't Repeat Yourself!! or "DRY"...</b> Perhaps one of the most important principles of good coding.  When you repeat yourself not only do you create more work for you, you increase the chances of introducing errors in your code and you make it that much harder for others to maintain, modify and debug your code.
                </p>
                <p>This <a href="http://area.autodesk.com/blogs/chris/the_principle_of_good_programming" target="_blank">link</a> points to a great article on "The Principles of Good Programming" which discusses repetition and other good coding practices.

                <h2 class="standard_content_title">HTML and CSS Errors</h2>
                <p>HTML and CSS are both programming languages with their own syntax and rules. Syntax and rules help ensure the language can coded, processed and understood consistently from person to person, browser to browser, etc...  It is important to check your code for syntax errors to ensure the code will work as expected (even though some browsers may still execute semantically incorrect code).  I've included links to HTML and CSS validation tools below in the "tools" section.   Also be sure to use the Chrome Developer Tools to help debug and validate your code.

                <h2 class="standard_content_title">Summary</h2>
                <p>
                    HTML is simply made up of a series of rectangles we put on a page. We use certain elements to layout our rectangles in either block-level or inline-level to control the flow of our pages.
                </p>
                <p>
                    Divs are block-level and spans are inline-level and are used differently. Divs are used more for grouping items together and creating a layout structure and spans are used to style text and individual elements.
                </p>
                <p>
                    Ids should be used sparingly and are used to uniquely identify an element. Class is recommended over id to style similar elements together.
                </p>
                <p>
                    Using Divs, Spans, IDs and Classes helps provide strucuture to HTML code.  Good code structure facilitates readability, understanding and maintainability.

                <h2 class="standard_content_title">Programming</h2>
                <p>A <b>computer</b> is a machine that can execute a program. With the right program, a computer can do any mechanical computation you can imagine.</p>
                <p>A <b>program</b> describes a very precise sequence of steps. Since the computer is just a machine, the program must give the steps in a way that can be executed mechanically. That is, the program can be followed without any thought.</p>
                <p>A <b>programming language</b> is a language designed for producing computer programs. A good programming language makes it easy for humans to read and write programs that can be executed by a computer.</p>
                <p><b>Python</b> is a programming language. The programs that we write in the Python language will be the input to the Python interpreter, which is a program that runs on the computer. The Python interpreter reads our programs and executes them by following the rules of the Python language.</p>

            <div class="standard_content panel">
                <h2 class="standard_content_title">Why do we need programming languages?</h2>
                <p>
                    <em>Why do we need to invent and learn new languages, like Python, to program computers, rather than using natural languages like English or Mandarin?</em>
                </p>
                
                    <ul>
                        <li>Ambiguity - there are a lot of ways to interpret natural language.</li>
                        <li>Verbosity - natural languages are verbose.</li>
                    </ul>
                
                <p>
                    There are many reasons why a designed language like Python is better for writing programs than a natural language like English. One problem with natural languages is that they are ambiguous. Hence, not everyone will interpret the same phrase the same way. To program computers, it is important that we know exactly what our programs mean, and that the computer will run them with the meaning we intended. Another problem with natural language is that they are very verbose. To say something with the level of precision needed for a computer to be able to follow it mechanically would require an awful lot of writing. We want our programs to be short so it is less work to write them, and so that it is easier to read and understand them.

                <h2 class="standard_content_title">Grammer</h2>
                <p>Compared to a natural language, like English, programming languages like Python adhere to a strict grammatical structure. In English, even if a phrase is written or spoken incorrectly, it can still be understood with the help of context or other cues. On the other hand, in a programming language like Python, the code must match the language grammar exactly. The Python interpreter has no idea what to do with input that is not in the Python language, so it produces an error.</p>

                was a pioneer in computing, a Navy rear admiral and the creator of COBOL - one of the first programming
                languages.  She built the first compiler (a program that takes as input a human readable programming
                language and outputs a program that computers can execute).  Compilers take convert the human readable code
                into machine executable code all at once and typically on the the executable output from the compiler is
                loaded into memory when the program is actually run on a computer.  Python is an interpreted language meaning the Python program converts the code one step at a time as the program runs.

                <p>
                    A variable is a name that refers to a value. In Python, we can use any sequence of letters and numbers and underscores (_) when we want to make a variable name, so long as it does not start with a number.  There is a Python convention that variable names should not start with a capital letter (for ease of readability). This is not a Python grammer rule, merely a best practice.
                </p>
                <p>
                    To introduce a new variable in Python we use an <b>assigment statement</b>, in the case of Python this
                    is the "=" sign.
                </p>
                <p> class="centered_text">
                    <em>name = expression</em>
                </p>
                <p>
                    After executing an assignment expression the <em>name</em> on the left of the "=" sign refers to the 
                    value on the right of the "=" sign.  Once a value has been assigned to a variable name the name can 
                    be referred to anywhere in the code and it will mean the same thing as the value it refers to. Here is an 
                    expression using a variable to print out weight_in_grams * 10. 
                </p>
                <p class="indented_text">
                    <b>
                        weight_in_grams = 100 <br>
                        print weight_in_grams * 10
                    </b>
                </p>
                <p>
                    Variables can be useful to programmers in many ways, here are a few of them:
                </p>
                    <ul class="small_text">
                        <li>Improving code readability by using names that make sense to people</li>
                        <li>Giving programmers ways to store the values of important dataL</li>
                        <li>Giving programmers a way to change the value of something (i.e <b>count = count - 1)</b></li>

                <h2 class="standard_content_title">String Basics</h2>
                <p>
                    A string in Python is a sequence of characters surrounded by quotes, either single or double.  The only
                    requirement is that the string must start and end with the same type of quote.  Double quotes are 
                    preferred as it allows you to include quotes as characters in the string.
                </p>
                <p>
                    You can use the "+" operator to concatenate strings:
                </p>
                <p class="centered_text">
                    <em>&lt;string&gt; + &lt;string&gt; </em>  &nbsp; outputs the concatenation of the two strings
                </p>
                <p>
                    You <b>cannot</b> use the "+" operator to combine
                    strings and integers.
                </p>
                <p>
                    You an use the "*" operator to <em>multiply</em> strings.  This essentially creates multiple copies
                    of the same string and concatenates them.  
                </p>
                <p class="indented_text">
                    <b>print '!' * 12</b><br>
                    !!!!!!!!!!!!
                </p>
                <p>The above program multiplies the string by the integer to return 12 exclamation points.</p>

                <h2 class="standard_content_title">Indexing Strings</h2>
                <p>
                    When you want to select sub-sequences from strings it is called <b>indexing</b>. Use the square
                    brackets <b>[]</b> to specify which part of the string you want.
                </p>
                <p class="indented_text">
                    <em>&lt; string &gt; <b>[</b> &lt; expression &gt; <b>]</b></em>
                </p>
                <p>
                    For example, if we have the string 'udacity' and we want to select the character in the zero position (that is, the first character), we would write:
                </p>
                <p class="indented_text">
                    <b>'udacity'[0]</b>
                </p>

                    <em>&lt;string &gt;<b>[</b> &lt;start expression &gt;:  &lt;stop expression &gt;<b>]</b></em> &nbsp; returns a string that is a sub-sequence of the characters in the string, from the start position up
                    to the character <em>before</em> the stop position.  If the start position is missing the sub-sequence
                    starts from the beginning of the string; if the stop position is missing the sub-sequence goes to
                    the end of the string.

                <p>
                    The <b>find method</b> is a built in operation, or method, provided by Python, that operates on strings.
                    The output of find is the position of the string where the specified sub-string is found
                </p>
                <p class="indented_text">

                </p>
                <p>
                    If the <em>target string</em> is not found anywhere in the <em>search string</em>, then the output
                    will be <b>-1</b>.

                <p>
                    In addition to passing in a target string to <b>find</b>, we can also pass in a number:
                </p>
                <p class="indented_text">
                    <em>&lt;search string &gt;<b>.find(</b> &lt;target string &gt;, &lt;number &gt;<b>)</b></em> 
                </p>
                <p>
                    The number input is the position in the search string where find will start looking for 
                    the target string. So, the output is a number giving the position of the first occurrence 
                    of the target string in the search string at or after the number input position. If there
                    is no occurrence at or after that position, the output is -1.

                    A function is a block of organized, reusable code that is used to perform a single, related action. Functions provide better modularity for your application and a high degree of code reusing.  Functions may take inputs, do something with the inputs and then produce output.
                </p>
                <p>
                    For example a function called <span class="code">cube</span> might take a number as input and return the cube of that number as output.

                    Use the keyword <span class="code">def</span> followed by the function name and and function <b>parameters</b> in parentheses to define a function.  The code block within a function starts with a ":" and is indented.  Use the <span class="code">return</span> keyword to return a result from the function.
                </p>
                <p>
                    The following code could be the definition of a function called

                    The "==" operator is used for equality comparisons in Python - because
                    the "=" operator is the assignment operator.  <span class="code">a == b</span> would be used to determine if a and b are equal whereas <span class="code">a = b</span> would be used to assign the current value represented by the variable "b" to the variable "a".   
                </p>
                <p>
                    "a" and "b" can also be Python expressions when used with the equality comparison operator.
                </p>
                <p>
                    The equality comparison operator <span class="code">==</span> returns <b>True</b> if the expressions being compared are in fact, equal.  Otherwise <b>False</b> is returned.

                <p>
                    You can add an <b>else</b> clause to an <b>if</b> statement to provide alternate code to execute
                    when the test expression is <b>False</b>.

                    The <b>or</b> expression give the logical or of two operands (expressions).  If either expression
                    evaluates to <b>True</b> the value of the <b>or</b> is <b>True</b>.  If both expressions are

                <h2 class="standard_content_title">While Loops</h2>
                <p>
                    Loops are a way to execute code repeatedly and are typically bounded by one or more 
                    test expressions.  The syntax for the <b>While</b> loop is very similar to the <b>if</b> 
                    statement:
                </p>
                <div class="code-block">
                    while &lt;TestExpression&gt;: <br>
                    <span class="indent">&lt;block&gt;</span> <br>      
                </div>
                <p>
                    A while loop executes the block any number of times - as long as the test expression 
                    is <b>True</b>.  Recall the <b>if</b> statement executes the block only once.  As with
                    the <b>if</b> statement the block to execute is determined by indentation.
                </p>               
                <p>
                    If the test expression for a while loop is true the block executes.  Then, the test expression
                    is evaluated again - if it is still true the block executes again.  This continues as long as
                    the test expression evaluates to <b>True</b>.  There is no guarantee that the test expression
                    will ever evaluate to <b>False</b>.  The loop could keep executing forever, which is known as
                    an <b>infinite loop</b>. 
                </p>
                <p>
                    Here is an example of a <b>while</b> loop:
                </p>
                <div class="code-block">
                    i = 0<br>
                    while i &lt; 10:<br>
                    <span class="indent">print i</span><br>
                    <span class="indent">i = i + 1</span><br>
                </div>
                <p>
                    The above code will execute as long as the test expression <em>i &lt; 10</em> is <b>True</b>.
                    In this example the code will prints i and then adds 1 to i.  The loop will repeat 10 times 
                    printing the numbers 0 through 9.

                        <li>Use print statements to print variables (intermediate results) at various 
                            locations in your code to make sure each part is working as designed.</li>
                        <li>Keep and compare old versions of your code.  Save working versions so
                            you have something to go back to if you introduce too many bugs.  Use
                            somthing like Git to automatically version your code.</li>

                <p>
                    Strings are considered a type of structured data in that you can access individual
                    characters and operate on sub-sequences.   Lists are similar to strings in that a
                    list is a grouping of ‘things’ however, the ‘things’ in a list may be any Python
                    value not just characters as with a string.   Structured data such as a Python list 
                    has some advantages over strings in that data can easily be stored, queried, analyzed 
                    and updated within the list structure.

                <h2 class="standard_content_title">Mutability</h2>
                <p>
                    Items in a list are also mutable - that is they can be changed.   Strings and substrings
                    are immutable - that is they cannot be changed.  Once a string value is assigned to a 
                    variable any future assignment statements using that variable name will only change 
                    where the variable points - the original string values are not changed.   Additionally 
                    you cannot use an assignment variable to update a substring of a string.
                </p>

                <h2 class="standard_content_title">Lists vs. Strings</h2>
                <p>
                    <span class="code">s = 'abcd'</span><br>
                    <span class="code">l = ['a','b','c','d']</span>
                </p> 
                <p>
                    In the code above the first line initializes a variable 's' which refers to the string 'abcd'. 
                    the second line creates a list 'l' containing 4 elements.                
                </p>
                <p>
                    <span class="code">t = s[0]</span><br>
                    <span class="code">m = l[0]</span>                    
                </p>
                <p>
                    The first statement above assigns the value 'a' to the variable 't'.  't' points to a location
                    in memory containing 'a' - not the same string as 's'.  The second statement assigns the value a to
                    the variable 'l' - similar to the first statement.
                </p>
                <p>
                    <span class="code">s[0] = 'x'</span><br>
                    <span class="code">l[0] = 'q'</span>                    
                </p> 
                <p>
                    The first statement above results in an error - you cannot assign a value to a substring in Python,
                    that is because <b>strings are immutable</b>. The second statement updates the original list and 
                    changes the first item in the list to 'q' so now the list 'l' is ['q','b','c','d'].  This 
                    demonstrates the <em>Mutability</em> of lists, i.e. they can be changed.

                <p>
                    Elements in a list can be of differing types - you can mix and match strings, numbers and even 
                    other lists! For example:
                </p> 
                <div class="code-block">
                    months = [["Jan", 31],["Feb", 28],["Mar", 31]]
                </div>
                <p>
                    Creates a list 'months' that contains three elements, each of which is a 2 element list.

                <h2 class="standard_content_title">Aliasing</h2>
                <p>
                    Consider the following code:
                </p>
                <div class="code-block">
                    p = ['H','e','l','l','o']<br>
                    p[0] = 'Y'<br>
                    q = p
                </div> 
                <p>
                    After the last assignment <span class="code">q = p</span> p and q refer to the same
                    list: <em>['Y','e','l','l','o']</em>.  So, anything done to mutate that list changes 
                    the value that both variables point to.  When multiple variables refer to the same object
                    it is called <b>aliasing</b>.

                <h2 class="standard_content_title">List Operations</h2>
                <p>
                    In this lesson we learned some of the built in operations on lists in Python: append, '+', and len.
                </p> 
                <p>
                    <b>Append.</b> Append adds a new element to the end of a list.  The append method mutates the list that 
                    it is invoked upon (it does not create a new list). Syntax:
                </p>
                <span class="code">&lt;list&gt;.append(&lt;element;&gt;)</span>
                <p>
                    <b>Concatenation.</b> The <b>+</b> operator when used with lists concatenates the lists creating 
                    a new list.  It does not mutate the original lists.
                </p>
                <span class="code">p = [0, 1]</span><br>
                <span class="code">q = [2, 3]</span><br>
                <span class="code">pq = p + q</span><br>
                <p>
                    pq now refers to a new list: [0 ,1 ,2 ,3].
                </p>
                <p> 
                    <b>Length.</b> The <b>len</b> operator is used to find out the length of an object.  <b>len</b> works
                    with any object that is a collection of things (including strings). The output of <b>len</b> is the 
                    number of elements in its input. Syntax:
                </p>
                <span class="code">len(&lt;list&gt;) -&gt; &lt;number&gt;</span>

            <div class="standard_content panel"> <!-- start of panel -->
                <h2 class="standard_content_title">Loops on Lists</h2>
                <p>
                    We can use <b>while</b>loops to loop through lists by setting an index counter variable and
                    incrementing it to step through the list.  However, Python provides an easier way to do this:
                    the <b>for</b> loop.  The syntax looks like this:
                </p> 
                <div class="code-block">
                    for &lt;name&gt; in &lt;list&gt;:<br>
                    <span class="indent">&lt;block&gt;</span>
                </div>
                <p>
                    The loop goes through each element in the list, assigning it to the <b>&lt;name&gt;</b> and
                    executing the <b>&lt;block&gt;</b>.  For example, to print all elements in a list you could
                    define the following procedure:
                </p>
                <div class="code-block">
                    def print_all_elements(p):<br>
                    <span class="indent">for e in p:</span><br>

                    A few more operations you can do with lists include:
                </p>
                <p>
                    <span class="code">&lt;list&gt;.index(&lt;value&gt;)</span> returns the first instance of &lt;value&gt;
                    in the list. Returns and error if &lt;value&gt; is not in the list.
                </p>
                <p>
                    <span class="code">&lt;value&gt; in &lt;list&gt;)</span> returns <b>True</b> if &lt;value&gt; is in the
                    list, <b>False</b> if it is not.
                </p>
                <p>
                    <span class="code">&lt;value&gt; not in &lt;list&gt;)</span> returns <b>True</b> if &lt;value&gt; is not in the
                    list, <b>False</b> if it is.
                </p>

                <p>
                    <b>Don't Panic.</b> Seriously - relax. Don't rush into writing code, or even designing algorithms.  Consider 
                    the problem statement holistically and think about how you can break the problem down into more 
                    manageable pieces.
                </p> 
                <p>
                    <b>Consider the Inputs.</b> How are the inputs represented?  What are their data types? Where you given any 
                    specifications to follow?  etc...
                </p>
                <p>
                    <b>Consider the Outputs.</b> How should you produce the outputs?  Print them? Use the <b>return</b> statement 
                    to return them?  What data types should you use?
                </p>
                <p>
                    <b>Work examples by hand.</b> Look at sample expected inputs and work through by hand what the expected
                    outputs would be for given inputs.  No coding yet at this point.  
                </p>
                <p>
                    <b>Develop a Mechanical Solution</b> Try working through a few cases as a human would solve the problem, 
                    for example.  In the daysBetweenDates problem from the class - it is reasonable to think a human might
                    resort to using a physical calendar to work through the problem by hand.  Use whatever physical tools you 
                    might use based on the specific problem to work through various scenarios of inputs and expected outputs. 
                </p>
                <p>
                    You can progress through this process by starting to create algorighms represented by pseudocode or rough 
                    Python code.  Consider the mechanical steps you worked out previously and work on algorithms to solve each 
                    step of the mechanical process.  Consider whether a simpler approach might be better for a computer than 
                    perhaps the approach a human would take.   
                </p>
                <p>
                    <b>Develop code Incrementally</b> When you have a workable algorithm and have thought about how to adapt it
                    for a computer.  Write code in small bits that are easily testable separately.  Building incrementally towards
                    solving the problem.
